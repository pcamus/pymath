## Working with derivatives.

The derivative of a function at a point indicates how the function varies near that point.

With a physical function depending on time, the derivative is the speed of variation of the physiqcal quantity associated with the function near the evaluation point.

With a function depending on coordinates, it gives the slope near the evaluation point.
