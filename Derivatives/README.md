## Working with derivatives.

The derivative of a function f(x) at a point indicates how the function varies near that point.

Definition of derivative of f(x) at the 'a' point -> $\displaystyle\left(\frac{df(x)}{dx}\right)\_{x=a}=\lim_{h \to 0}\left(\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}\right)$

The derivative only exists if the limit exists.

With a physical function depending on time, the derivative is the speed of variation of the physiqcal quantity associated with the function near the evaluation point.

With a function depending on coordinates, it gives the slope near the evaluation point.

If we calculate the derivative of a function f at a point x, we obtain the derivative function of f, ie a symbolic expression of the derivative valid for all the points where the derivative exists.
