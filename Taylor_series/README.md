## Taylor series.

Taylor series give approximation of functions with a polynomial equation, around a value.

See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series) for a description Taylor series.

We can use these polynomial to compute function with only the 4 elementary operations. Bu the accuracy with few terms is not very good.

Another, mor powerful, algorithms exist, for instance the cordic algoritm.
