### Computing limits.

In this repository, you will discover how to deal with the limits of sequences and functions.

In the first part you will use a graphical and a gradual approach to the limit values and become aware of some pitfalls of those methods.

In the second part you will start using the [sympy](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html) module allowing you to make symbolic computation (in contrast to numerical computation).

- [Numerical approach](num_limit).
- [Symbolic approach](sym_limit).
