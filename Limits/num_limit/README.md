### Numerical approach.

The first method we can use, is to look at the graph to get an idea of how the sequence or function behaves when they approach the limit. 

Here is the result for the sequence and the function we already have described. The limit of interest is infinity.

We can see that the first one seems to converge toward 0.5 and the second one toward 0.
