### Numerical approach.

The first method we can use, is to look at the graph to get an idea of how the sequence or function behaves when they approach the limit. 

Here is the result for the sequence and the function we already have described. The limit of interest is infinity.

We can see that the first one seems to converge toward 0.5 and the second one toward 0 (a = 20, f = 50).

Another method constists in listing the values of the sequence or function when we tend to the limit. It means in our two exwmple when the variable gets bigger and bigger.
