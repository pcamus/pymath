## Integrals and antiderivatives.

The integral of the function can be described as the area under a function between 2 abscissas.


In this diagram we see that the area is the sum of the rectangle when the width approaches 0. 

The exists if the limit exists.

With a physical function depending on time, the derivative is the speed of variation of the physical quantity associated with the function near the evaluation point.

With a function depending on coordinates, it gives the slope near the evaluation point.

If we calculate the derivative of a function f(x) at a point x (i.e. any point), we obtain the derivative function of f(x), a symbolic expression of the derivative valid for all the points where the derivative exists.
