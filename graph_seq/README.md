## Doing graphs with pyplot and using numpy to create sequences.
The first example is a simple program that walks through how to create a sequence of values and display it graphically.

The index of the sequence is a natural number.

Here is the program : [num_sequence.py](num_sequence.py)

The Python code is made of 5 parts :

- Module import.

`numpy` and `pyplo`t are imported

- Function and variables declaration.
- Vectors allocation.
- Filling of the vector with abscissa and corresponding ordinate values.
- Plotting initialisation and display.

The resulting display is :
